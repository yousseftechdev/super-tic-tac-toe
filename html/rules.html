        <p>1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid of 3x3 grids.</p>
        <p>2. Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) in one of the small cells.</p>
        <p>3. A player wins a small grid by getting three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).</p>
        <p>4. Winning a small grid gives the player control of that grid in the larger game.</p>
        <p>5. The first player to win three small grids in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.</p>
        <p>6. If a player is sent to a small grid that has already been won or is full, they can choose any other small grid.</p>
