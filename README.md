# Super Tic Tac Toe Rules

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid of 3x3 grids.
2. Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) in one of the small cells.
3. A player wins a small grid by getting three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
4. Winning a small grid gives the player control of that grid in the larger game.
5. The first player to win three small grids in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
6. If a player is sent to a small grid that has already been won or is full, they can choose any other small grid.
